        <p class="mt-4">With millions of insurance claims being processed annually, insurance fraud remains a pervasive issue that poses significant challenges in the United States.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>An estimated 20% of insurance claims are fraudulent.</li>
            <li>Fraud is the second-most costly white-collar crime in America, after tax evasion.</li>
            <li>Insurance fraud results in higher premiums for consumers, as well as higher taxes and inflation on consumer goods.</li>
            <li>The Coalition Against Insurance Fraud reports that 78% of consumers are concerned about insurance fraud.</li>
            <li>Somewhere between 1.3 and 2.1 million people each month in 2020 were intentionally misclassified as independent contractors or paid off the books, a fraudulent tactic used by employers to reduce their workersâ€™ compensation premiums.</li>
            <li>Insurance fraud is a federal offense under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which allows the federal government to address the issue when interstate commerce is involved.</li>
            <li>On the state level, all 50 states and the District of Columbia regard insurance fraud as a crime for at least some types of insurance, with insurer fraud being a specific crime in 30 states.</li>
        </ul>
